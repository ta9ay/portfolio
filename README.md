# Data Science and Analytics Portfolio

## Overview
This is a collection of all the projects I've worked on related to data analysis, data science, and machine learning. I'm an aspiring data analyst/ scientist, and I've always felt that personally I learn best through practical experience. This repository is a journal of the progress I've made through the years on my journey of exploring this field.<br>
<b>It's still a work in progress as I'll keep updating it with new projects, and old projects that I haven't documented just yet.<b>


## [NYC Taxi analysis](https://github.com/ta9ay/NYC-taxi-analysis)
Exploratory Data Analysis of over 130 million rows of data collected from NYC taxis. 

## [Analyzing ratings creep in Hollywood movies](https://github.com/ta9ay/movie-analysis)
There has been a rising concern about a ratings creep, i.e. the movie ratings have become less stringent over time. People have felt that newer movies contain more explicit content, strong language and nudity as compared to older similarly rated movies. This project uses NLP models, quantitative data, and statistical tests to analyze if this ratings creep actually exists.

## [Neural network writted from scratch](https://github.com/ta9ay/NeuralNet-from-scratch)
A simple feed-forward neural network written in Python. Uses SGD for backpropogation. It's a simplified version of a neural network that I wrote to better understand the way an NN works.

## [Neuroevolution Flappy Bird](https://github.com/ta9ay/NeuroEvolution-FlappyBird)
Training a bot to play a graphically simplified version of FlappyBird (written in PyGame) using the neuroevolution algorithm. Utilizes the self-written neural network module.
